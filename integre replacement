Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:

If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n = n //2
            elif n % 4 == 1 or n == 3:
                n -= 1
            else:
                n += 1
            cnt += 1
        
        return cnt
